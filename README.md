# recipen

Problem Statement: 
Many experimental cooks enjoy taking existing recipes and making their own changes to them. Often times these modifications are all based on gut feeling, and aren't written down. The results of that are modified recipes that turn out really well but can never be reproduced the exact same way again. 

Solution: 
recipiece provides a simple way to enter and save recipes, keeping them organized and consistent.
